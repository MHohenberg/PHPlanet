* Everything ;) More specifically

1. get the thing to read CSS files, either by a cron-like process
   or by fetching feeds "on the fly".

2. show the feeds in a nice, smart(y) way.
2.1 either in full length, or up to a specific length.
2.1.1 allow the Administrator to specify feeds that override that 
      setting, e.g. show all content for blog A while all others
      are cut at 3 sentences and vice versa.
2.2 with using rel="noref"
2.2.1 ... the administrator can override this for specific blogs


3. Analyze blogs and make a tag cloud for specific keywords
3.1 ... where the keywords can be either created on-the-fly or put together
	by the Administrator
3.2 ... where there can be "badwords" that do not appear under any 
	circumstances
